A iOS Custom camera made on top of AVFoudation.


## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create a simple Camera App and understand how to use AVFoundation.
The core of this app will be the CameraController class that handles all camera functionalities, such as, choose between front and back cameras, turn on/off flash mode and save on Photos.
The CameraController class will be in the end a sort of third part framework, like so, I can reuse it for futures apps.

### Details matter...

- All comments in this code is meant for my future self.
- Despite of a main goal has already been described, another goal is to put on practice SOLID principles and, to do so, a lot of commits refactoring the code will be pushed up.
- NO NIBs will be use.
